# SpiritGuide
WDI Project 3

SpiritGuide is a web application that will lead users to yoga studios, vegetarian restaurants, juice bars and farmers markets by searching one of the five boroughs of New York. Built with Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js, data was parsed and displayed via Yelp's API and NYC OpenData. Search results saved to a user's profile populated a PostgreSQL database using a Rails server.
