## About
SpiritGuide is a web application that will lead users to yoga studios, vegetarian restaurants, juice bars and farmers markets by searching one of the five boroughs of New York. Built with Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js, data was parsed and rendered via Yelp's API and NYC OpenData. Location data for businesses is displayed via Google Maps API. Search results saved to a user's profile populated a PostgreSQL database using a Rails server.

## To Use
To use SpiritGuide, simply create a valid account or login to your existing account (guest information below). After signing up, login to search by one of the five New York boroughs and click the type of business or market you'd like to see results from. Once your results are shown, save a particular business or market to your profile so you can keep track of places you have or have not visited. Visit your profile to see these saved places, edit your account or delete your account.
